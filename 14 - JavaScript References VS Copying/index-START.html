    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; 

    console.log(team);

    // team is a reference to the original array
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]
    console.log(players);
    // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"] 
    console.log(team); 


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    // ^ Start with a new empty object, person is the source and add property (number) we want to it


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 12,
      social : {
        twitter: '@x',
        facebook: 'x' 
      }
    }

    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.log(wes); 

    // Now, change social in dev will also change wes.social, that's BAD!
    // Objec to string then to Object, which will erase the reference, but this is not recommended!
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
